# Discrete Math Labs

This repository contains the solutions for the labs I completed in my **Discrete Mathematics** course. Each lab focuses on a specific topic related to set theory, combinatorics, relations, and their properties, with practical programming tasks to solve.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1.1: Set Operations
- **Task 1**: Write programs to calculate the values of set expressions (as per "report," p.1 and p.2).
- **Task 2**: Using the programs from task 1, calculate the values of other set expressions (as per "report," p.4).

### Lab 1.2: Cantor's Normal Forms
- **Task 1**: Implement methods to obtain different Cantor normal forms of a set given an arbitrary set-theoretic expression.

### Lab 1.3: Set-Theoretic Identities
- **Task 1**: Prove the identity of expressions 2 and 4 using logical functions. Create a program that generates and compares the truth tables of these logical functions.
- **Task 2**: Prove the identity of expressions 3 and 4 using set-theoretic methods. Write a program to compute and compare the values of these expressions for sets A = {1, 3, 5, 7}, B = {2, 3, 6, 7}, and C = {4, 5, 6, 7}.

### Lab 1.4: Set-Theoretic Equations
- **Task 1**: Write a program that computes the values of the sets φ^∅ and ~(φ^U) for given initial sets.
- **Task 2**: Write a program to verify the solutions found in task 1.

### Lab 2.1: Algorithms for Generating Combinatorial Objects
- **Task 1**: Implement an algorithm to generate subsets.
- **Task 2**: Implement an algorithm to generate combinations.
- **Task 3**: Implement an algorithm to generate permutations.
- **Task 4**: Implement an algorithm to generate arrangements.

### Lab 2.2: Combinatorial Practice
- **Task 1**: Arrange the numbers from a given nine-element set into a "number wheel" such that one number is in the center and the others are at the ends of each diameter. The sums of the numbers in each row should be equal.

### Lab 3.1: Relations and Their Properties
- **Task 1**: Write a program to implement operations on relations.
- **Task 2**: Write a program to determine the properties of a relation (reflexivity, antireflexivity, symmetry, antisymmetry, transitivity, antitransitivity, completeness, tolerance, equivalence, order).

### Lab 3.2: Transitive Closure of Relations
- **Task 1**: Develop and programmatically implement a generator for relations on a set of size N with a specified number of pairs.
- **Task 2**: Write a program that generates 1000 relations on a set of size N with a specified number of pairs, computes the transitive closure of each relation using two different algorithms, and measures the execution time for each algorithm.
